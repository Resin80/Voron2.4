[nevermore]
# Can omit if you have only one nevermore in range.
# See <<Finding The BT Address>> for more info.
# NOTE: Providing an address will make startup slightly faster.
#       (If no address is provided then the system must spend extra time
#        verifying that there's only one nearby Nevermore.)
example - `bt_address: 43:43:A2:12:1F:AC`
#serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Nevermore_Filter_pico_w_E66178758B897B36-if02


# seconds, 0 to disable, how long to wait at startup before failing if Klipper can't connect
# If disabled (set to 0) the module will not error on startup if it cannot connect.
# Disabling this requires that `bt_address` is set.
# Cannot be used w/ `serial`.
#
# WARNING:  **Do not disable unless you've fully tested everything in the filter.**
#           i.e. it should be ready for a serial # request on the Discord.
#           Disabling makes it difficult to decern if a problem is caused by connection issues
#           or something else.
# WARNING:  If you set this < 10 seconds you will likely have trouble connecting.
# NOTE:     **After** startup module will always quietly keep trying to reconnect if connection,
#           regardless of what value is set for `connection_initial_timeout`.
# NOTE:     It takes some amount of time to reliably scan & connect to Nevermore.
#           This varies on a few factors outside of your control, so the system
#           will reject unfeasibly small timeout values to keep you from screwing
#           yourself over.
#connection_initial_timeout: <default varies based on whether `bt_address` is set>
